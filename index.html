      <h2>Why We Fast</h2>
      <p>
        Fasting isn’t about skipping meals or being extra spiritual.
        It’s about making space for God and removing distractions so we can hear Him more clearly.
        We’re not fasting to get something from God—we’re fasting to give Him our first and best.

      <h2>A Message from Pastor Mason</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>Victory Hill Family,</p>

        <p>As we wrap up our first week of 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting, I just want to pause and say this to you: <strong>I’m proud of you.</strong></p>

        <p>I know some of you jumped in ready. Some of you eased in a little slower. And some of you are still figuring out what this season looks like for you.</p>

        <p>Wherever you are, you’re not behind. You’re right where God can meet you.</p>

        <p>This year, we challenged our church to something a little different. Along with personal fasts, we stepped into a soul fast by intentionally stepping away from social media and endless scrolling. Not because social media is bad, but because we wanted to create space. Space to listen. Space to breathe. Space to pray.</p>

        <p><strong>And here’s what I want you to hear clearly:</strong></p>

        <p>God is not asking you for perfection. He’s inviting you into connection.</p>

        <h3>From This Week’s Teaching</h3>
        <p>We talked about Practical Prayer and the discipline of prayer. One of the most important things we said was this:</p>

        <p><em>Prayer is learned. Prayer is practiced. Prayer is proven.</em></p>

        <p>The disciples didn’t say, “Teach us how to preach.” They said, “Lord, teach us to pray.”</p>

        <p>If prayer feels awkward, inconsistent, or unfamiliar to you, you’re in good company. Prayer grows the same way relationships do—one conversation at a time.</p>

        <h3>A Simple Way to Practice Prayer</h3>
        <p>Pick one time, one place, and one simple prayer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One time:</strong> when you wake up, in the car, on a lunch break, before bed</li>
          <li><strong>One place:</strong> the kitchen, the driveway, the shower, your truck</li>
          <li><strong>One simple prayer:</strong> “God, I’m here.” “God, help me today.” “God, let Your will shape mine.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you think to pray—pray. It doesn’t have to be long. It just has to be real.</p>

        <h3>About Fasting</h3>
        <p>Fasting isn’t about what you’re giving up. It’s about what you’re making room for.</p>
        <p>If this first week has felt harder than expected, don’t quit. If it’s felt quieter than expected, lean in. If you’ve stumbled or had to reset, grace is still available. God meets us in the showing up.</p>

        <h3>Don’t Walk This Alone</h3>
        <p>Our Wednesday Prayer Nights have already been powerful. If you haven’t made it yet, I want to personally invite you to join us this Wednesday at 6:00 PM. Childcare is available for birth through kindergarten.</p>

        <p>And remember—prayer isn’t just something we do in a room. It’s something we carry into our everyday lives.</p>

        <p><strong>Either God will move the situation, or God will move you. Both are gifts.</strong></p>

        <p>I’m grateful to walk this journey with you. Let’s keep showing up together.</p>

        <p>With you and for you,  
        <br><strong>Pastor Mason</strong></p>

    <!-- WEEK TWO -->
    <section>
      <h2>Week Two: WORK</h2>
      <p>Jesus in what we do, not just where we go.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 8: Purpose</h3>
        <p class="scripture">Colossians 3:23 — “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart...”</p>
        <p>God can use every bit of what you do—work, home, or school—as part of His kingdom. He’s not just calling pastors. He’s calling you.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Help me serve You in everything I do.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Ask God to show you the purpose in your current season.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 9: Stewardship</h3>
        <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 4:2</p>
        <p>God entrusts us with time, energy, and influence. Stewarding well doesn’t mean doing more—it means aligning your life with what matters most.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Teach me to steward my time, talents, and tasks well.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Take inventory of where your time is going this week.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 10: Influence</h3>
        <p class="scripture">Matthew 5:13</p>
        <p>You may never hold a microphone, but your life speaks. Influence is less about platform and more about presence. Let others see Jesus in you.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Use me to influence others for Your glory.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Encourage or bless someone in your workplace or school.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 11: Joy in the Doing</h3>
        <p class="scripture">Ecclesiastes 3:12–13</p>
        <p>There’s joy in the ordinary. You don’t need a dream job to live on purpose. Ask God to meet you in the middle of your normal.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Restore joy in my daily responsibilities.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Name one thing you enjoy about your work or daily tasks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 12: Provision</h3>
        <p class="scripture">Philippians 4:19</p>
        <p>Provision isn’t always money. God provides peace, strength, and wisdom too. He is your source—not your paycheck.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>I trust You to meet my needs.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Thank God for one recent way He’s provided.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 13: Wisdom</h3>
        <p class="scripture">James 1:5</p>
        <p>God gives wisdom freely. You don’t have to have all the answers—just ask Him. Wisdom is available for every decision, big or small.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Give me wisdom for today’s decisions.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Ask the Holy Spirit to lead one choice today.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 14: Rest</h3>
        <p class="scripture">Exodus 20:8</p>
        <p>Rest is not laziness. It’s worship. When you rest, you’re saying: God, I trust You more than my schedule.</p>
        <p class="label">Prayer:</p>
        <p>Help me honor rest as part of obedience.</p>
        <p class="label">Action:</p>
        <p>Schedule intentional time to rest this weekend.</p>
