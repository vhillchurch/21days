      <h2>Why We Fast</h2>
      <p>Fasting isn’t about skipping meals or being extra spiritual. It’s about voluntarily giving something up to seek God with more focus. It’s about tuning out distractions and tuning into His voice.</p>
      <p>We’re not fasting to get something from God—we’re fasting to give Him our first and best as we begin the year.</p>

      <h2>Types of Fasts</h2>
      <p>Everyone is invited to choose a fast that fits their life and spiritual journey. Whether you're new to fasting or have done it before, the most important thing is that it stretches you to rely more on God. This year, we are encouraging <strong>everyone at Victory Hill to participate in a Soul Fast</strong>—disconnecting from digital distractions alongside your chosen food fast.</p>

      <h3>Complete Fast</h3>
      <p>This is a full fast from all solid foods. You only consume liquids such as water, light juices, or broths. It’s best suited for those with experience in fasting and who are physically healthy enough to take it on. Always consult a medical professional if you have health concerns.</p>

      <h3>Selective Fast</h3>
      <p>Also known as a "Daniel Fast," this involves removing specific foods like meat, sweets, dairy, and processed items. Many choose to eat only fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and water. This is a great option for those looking to reset physical and spiritual rhythms at the same time.</p>

      <h3>Partial Fast</h3>
      <p>Sometimes called a time-based fast, this involves fasting for a specific part of the day—like skipping breakfast and lunch, and eating only dinner. This method mirrors the idea of intermittent fasting and can help you practice daily discipline and dependence on God.</p>

      <h3>Soul Fast (Everyone is Called to This)</h3>
      <p>This is a powerful fast of the mind and emotions—letting go of things that distract you mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. A Soul Fast is about replacing noise with clarity, and stress with Scripture. It may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fasting all social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)</li>
        <li>Turning off streaming platforms like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc.</li>
        <li>Avoiding news media, gaming, or online shopping</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are asking <strong>every person at Victory Hill</strong> to unplug from social media for the full 21 days and replace that time with intentional time with God—prayer, worship, Scripture, and silence.</p>

      <p>Remember: the goal isn’t just to give something up. It’s to make space for something better—God’s voice, peace, and presence.</p>
