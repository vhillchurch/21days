    <!-- WHY FAST -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why We Fast</h2>
      <p>
        Fasting isn’t about skipping meals or being extra spiritual. It’s about creating space—intentionally—
        to hear God more clearly. We’re not fasting to get something from God.
        We’re fasting to give Him our first and best as we begin the year.
      </p>

    <!-- FASTING TYPES -->
    <section>
      <h2>Types of Fasts</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone is invited to choose a fast that fits their life and spiritual journey.
        This year, we are encouraging <strong>everyone at Victory Hill to participate in a Soul Fast</strong>,
        alongside a food fast of your choice.
      </p>

      <div class="fasting-type">
        <h3>Complete Fast</h3>
        <p>
          A fast from all solid foods, consuming only liquids such as water, light juices, or broths.
          This is best for those with prior fasting experience and good health.
          Always consult a medical professional if you have concerns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fasting-type">
        <h3>Selective Fast (Daniel Fast)</h3>
        <p>
          Removing certain foods such as meat, sweets, or processed items.
          The Daniel Fast focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and water.
          This is a great option for a spiritual and physical reset.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fasting-type">
        <h3>Partial Fast</h3>
        <p>
          Fasting during certain times of the day, such as skipping breakfast and lunch.
          This helps build daily discipline and dependence on God.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fasting-type">
        <h3>Soul Fast (Everyone Is Called to This)</h3>
        <p>
          A fast from digital and emotional distractions.
          This may include stepping away from social media, streaming platforms, news, gaming,
          or anything that steals focus and peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these 21 days, we’re asking everyone at Victory Hill to unplug from social media
          and replace that time with prayer, Scripture, worship, and quiet.
        </p>
      </div>
